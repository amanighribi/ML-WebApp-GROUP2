# Interactive Web Application for Dataset-Driven Machine Learning Model Selection and Analysis

---

**Project ID:** ML N°2

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an interactive web-based platform that enables users to upload datasets, select among several machine learning models, tune hyperparameters, and visualize performance metrics. The tool will prioritize ease of use, educational impact, and model explainability—making it suitable for students and non-expert users.
